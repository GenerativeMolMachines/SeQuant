# SeQuant
Package for generating embeddings using the author's neural network.

## Datasets description
### Benchmarking datasets
The .csv files named antidia, antiinf, antimic and antiox are datasets used for benchmarking process.
### Energy data
File named as energy_data.csv is a dataset that contains DFT-derived descriptors. It is essential for the proper functioning of the tool.
### Small datasets
small_train_df.csv and small_test_df.csv are files partly used in SeQuant learning, here they were used for obtaining physicochemical propeties of the peptides with external library.
